I'm a second-year Master student at Institute of
Information Engineering (IIE), Chinese Academy of Sciences
(CAS), supervised by
<a href="" target="_blank">Prof. Jing Yu</a>. I'm also
lucky to have opportunities to collaborate with
<a href="http://www.qi-wu.me/home.html">Qi Wu</a>
(Professor at Adelaide),
<a href="https://dblp.org/pers/w/Wang:Yujing.html">Yujing Wang</a>
(Researcher at MSRA) and
<a href="http://www.chuanzhou.online/">Chuan Zhou</a>
(Professor at AMSS, CAS). Before this, I got my Bachelor's
degree in Computer Science and Technology from China
University of Mining and Technology (2014-2018).
<br />
<br />
My primary research interests are Multi-modal Machine
Learning. Specifically, my current research focuses on
vision and language, e.g. visual/video question answering,
visual dialog, image/video captioning, and visual
grounding.
